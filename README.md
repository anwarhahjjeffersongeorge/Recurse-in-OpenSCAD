This project contains some basic codes by which certain recursive ond list comprehension based 
operations may be performed within the [OpenSCAD parametric modeling language](https://github.com/openscad/openscad).

##### This version includes functionality like being able to:

1. Generate fibonnaci numbers,
2. Generate highly degenerate pseudospirals using said fibonnaci numbers, and 
3. Manipulate one-dimensional vectors and vectors containing vector elements (flip backwards, multiply a dimension by a scalar, etc.)
4. Generate arithmetic progressions and geometric progressions in vector form.
5. Access vector elements in circular fashion with next() and prev() regardless of index
