This project contains some basic codes by which certain recursive operations may be performed within the OpenSCAD parametric modeling language.

###### The initial version includes functionality like being able to:

1. Generate fibonnaci numbers,
2. Generate highly degenerate pseudospirals using said fibonnaci numbers, and 
3. Manipulate one-dimensional vectors and vectors containing vector elements.
